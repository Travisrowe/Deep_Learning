Coputation Graph
    The compuation of an NN is organized in terms of:
        Forward Pass - forward propogation - compute the output of the NN 
        Backward Pass - backward propogation - compute the gradient or derivatives
    A Computational Graph is handy or helpful when there is some special output variable that you want or need to optimize
    
    In the case of logistic regression J
        J(a, b, c) = 3(a + bc)
        a = 5, b = 3, c = 2
            we define bc = u
            a + bc = v = a + u
            3(a + bc) = J = 3v

        Backward propogation goes right to left to calculate the derivatives. it's on paper
            We use the derivatives in gradient descent
            
    Gradient Descent in the logistic regression scenario. it's on paper
