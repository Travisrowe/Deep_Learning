Neural Network is a sophisticated algorithm inspired by the brain
Input - Data
Processing - node = activation unit
Output

Linear Regression
y = mx + b

Algebra - used in matrices
Calculus - increase speed of learning
Statistics and Probability - to decide what will happen and what is good about it.

    ex) predict the price of houses
        We know that
        a)  House prices are positive, not negative
        b)  There is an input parameter - x, the size of the house 
        c)  There is an output - Price
        d)  There is a function
        
        Neuron = node = activation unit, they all mean the same. They are what you feed input into, the neuron processes it and sends output.
            Inside the node is an activation function
            
            Activation Function has multiple classes
                Sigmoid
                RELU - Rectify Linear Unit
                Tan(h)
                
                These all have graph meanings
                
    ex) Multiple NNs - Price = f(size, number of rooms, zip code, wealth of neighborhood)
        Size of house + rooms -> family size
        zip code -> workability
        zip code + wealth -> school quality
        Family size + workability + school quality -> Price
    
Supervised Learning
    Characteristics
    a) you are given a data set
    b) you know what your correct output should look like so you have
        1) a real output, y 
        2) a predicted output, y^ (y hat)
        Check difference between y and y^
    S.L. categories
        1) Regression problems
        2) Classification problems
     
    Regression problems - try to map input variables to some continuous function

    Classification problems - attempting to map input variables into some discrete category
        In other words, you are attempting to predict results into a discrete category.
        
    Standard NN
    CNN - Conv Neural Network
    RMN
    Hybrid customizeds
    
    Data Classification
        Structured - It makes reference to data that has a very well-defined meaning
            ex) a table in a database
        Un-structured - The opposit
            ex) Audio, image, text
