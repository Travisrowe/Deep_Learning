array functions with numpy
numpy.zeros(10) #makes an array with 10 0s in it
numpy.reshape(4,3) #reshapes an array, I believe preserving every value inside the original that will fit in the new

multiplying matrices in Anaconda is element-wise UNLESS you use numpy.dot(array1, array2). This is real matrix multiplication.
Matrix multiplication:
    A(i, j) * B(k, m) = C(i, m)
        if j = k, you can multiply these matrices
        else, you cannot
        
numpy.transpose is also a function 

HW? Create a numpy matrix filled with three 2x2 matrices, filled with 1-12 [1, 2]
                                                                           [3, 4], is one matrix inside the large matrix
